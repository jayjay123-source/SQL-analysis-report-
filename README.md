# SQL Analysis Report: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

## Introduction
As part of my ongoing learning journey in Business Intelligence and SQL analytics, I undertook a practical data exploration and analysis project to sharpen my ability to interpret real-world business data, write efficient queries, and extract meaningful insights. This case study helped reinforce key concepts in data manipulation, aggregation, and strategic business interpretation using SQL and data analysis tools.

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing historical order data from Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a Lagos-based retailer specializing in office supplies and furniture. The company serves a diverse customer base ranging from individuals to large corporate clients. 
The goal was to support strategic decision-making for their Abuja division by uncovering patterns, trends, and improvement opportunities from 2009–2012 sales data.
Project Topic
Kultra Mega Stores Inventory.
Two structured CSV files were provided:
- KMS Sql Case Study.csv (primary dataset with order and sales details)
- Order_Status.csv (return status for specific orders)
The data was already cleaned and well-structured, making it efficient to query and interpret.
